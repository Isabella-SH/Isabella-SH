  <p>I am about to start my fourth year studying Software Engineering at the UPC (Peruvian University of Applied Sciences). I am looking to put into practice all my acquired knowledge, as well as make my human potential available to the organization in a dynamic work environment which allows me to develop professionally.</p>
